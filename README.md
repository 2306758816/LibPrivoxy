Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.<br/>

Many people want to integrate Privoxy into their own projects, I made some changes to the Privoxy codes to compiled into a DLL or static library, so that you can better integrate it into their own projects.<br/>
